# Specification Quality Checklist: Icon Sidebar Navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Package/library names (lucide-vue-next, Element Plus tooltip, `useHumanTaskCount`) appear only in **Assumptions**, deliberately, because the iteration 9 decision fixed the dependency and reuse choices; the FR/SC bodies stay behavior-focused and tech-agnostic. Consistent with the house style of prior BRIGADIR specs (007/008) for an internal tool.
